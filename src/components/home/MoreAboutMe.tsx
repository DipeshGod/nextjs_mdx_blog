          <p>
            I am Martin Fowler: an author, speakerâ€¦ essentially a loud-mouthed
            pundit on the topic of software development, primarily for
            Enterprise Applications. I work for Thoughtworks, a software
            delivery company, where I have the exceedingly inappropriate title
            of {"Chieft Scientist"}I have written half-a-dozen books on software
            development, including Refactoring, and Patterns of Enterprise
            Application Architecture. I write for and edit the website
            martinfowler.com.
